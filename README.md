- CLI-J is an application that allows the user to create, read, update, and delete categorized journal entries easily from their terminal.
- After creating an account, associated with an e-mail address, the user can configure the application to automatically send daily/weekly/monthly e-mails to their e-mail address containing the notes from that time period.
- The purpose is to allow the user to quickly create and collect notes for meetings and other work events.
